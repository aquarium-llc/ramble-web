        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

        <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 9, 2026</p>

        <p>Ramble is an app for having real-time voice conversations with friends while walking, driving, or moving through your day. We aim to collect only the information needed to make that experience work.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

        <h4>Information We Collect</h4>

        <p><strong>Information you provide</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account information:</strong> phone number, real name, username, and profile photo.</li>
          <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> if you choose, you may upload your full address book or select specific contacts to help you connect with friends on Ramble. This choice is entirely up to you. Contacts are used solely to help you find and connect with friends on Ramble.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Information created by using Ramble</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Call metadata:</strong> who participated in a call, when it started and ended, and its duration.</li>
          <li><strong>Step count during calls:</strong> we record the number of steps taken while a call is active. Step count is used only to reflect activity during calls and is not used for health analysis, medical purposes, or advertising.</li>
          <li><strong>Location data during calls:</strong> we record location during calls to show you the path you traveled. This collection is entirely optional.</li>
          <li><strong>Availability signals:</strong> when you indicate that you're available to talk.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Information we do not collect</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>We do <strong>not</strong> record calls.</li>
          <li>We do <strong>not</strong> store, listen to, or analyze audio.</li>
          <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How We Use Information</h4>

        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Connect you with friends for live voice conversations.</li>
          <li>Show basic activity related to calls (such as duration and step count).</li>
          <li>Operate, maintain, and improve Ramble.</li>
          <li>Monitor app stability and performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do not use your data for advertising.</p>

        <h4>Analytics and Diagnostics</h4>

        <p>We use third-party analytics and diagnostics tools (including PostHog) to understand basic usage patterns and app performance. This includes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>App interactions (such as button taps)</li>
          <li>Crash reports</li>
          <li>General usage metrics</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These tools do not give us access to call audio.</p>

        <h4>Sharing Information</h4>

        <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

        <p>We may share limited information:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>With service providers that help us operate Ramble (such as hosting, analytics, or VoIP infrastructure), under contractual confidentiality obligations.</li>
          <li>If required by law or to protect the safety and integrity of Ramble and its users.</li>
        </ul>

        <p></p>
        <h4>Data Retention</h4>

        <p>We retain information only as long as necessary to operate the service and meet legal or operational needs.</p>

        <p>You may request deletion of your account and associated personal data by contacting us at support@ramble.co.</p>

        <h4>Your Choices</h4>

        <p>You can:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Decide whether to upload your full address book or only specific contacts.</li>
          <li>Stop using Ramble at any time.</li>
          <li>Request access to or deletion of your data by contacting us.</li>
          <li>Mute, remove, or block other users to manage who can contact you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h4>Security</h4>

        <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. No system is completely secure, and you use Ramble at your own risk.</p>

        <h4>Children's Privacy</h4>

        <p>Ramble is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

        <h4>Changes to This Policy</h4>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as Ramble evolves. We'll update the "Last updated" date when changes are made.</p>
